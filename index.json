[{"content":"If you read any blog or experience of moving or working abroad, you will always find a paragraph that reminds you of all the Bollywood movies you’ve lived through — I am thinking a mix of Queen, Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara, and Kajol singing “Mere desh ki dharti” in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gam.\nNew city, new me, new life. A montage of walking around in the bustling new city, laughing over drinks with new friends, hiking, attending events. It’s a cocktail of good vibes, exciting adventures and the dream life.\nI mean, I am guilty of doing the same.\nSo wait, it is all a ruse? Are all of us just lying that moving abroad changed our lives for good, and that we are having the best of times? Nopes. No. Not at all. We are all just selectively talking about things we like. Painting a full picture, but forgetting to mention how difficult it was simply to find the paints, or that picture frame.😅\nI hear these reasons to move abroad often, and I had similar ones. Time to talk more about them.\nMoving to a new city will change my life. True and False.\nI had the privilege of living in Barcelona and London. It all feels so romantic and filmy through a couple of filtered stories, and reels with those trending songs. It is. It truly is, sometimes I can’t believe this is my life.\nBut so is Bangalore, and Guwahati and Bhopal. Or any other city that you are living in. Yeah having a few celebrated monuments and culturally filled calendars certainly does help, not denying that one bit.\n But hear me out. Romanticising your life is a mindset. it is very easy to fall into a pattern in your new city, and before you know it, you are leading your good old former life.\n Pouring tea in your favorite mug while your houseplants flourish in the background has the same aesthetics, and happiness everywhere. Your local barista knowing your order looking at your face gives you the same pride. And so does the thrill of being in a new place where you haven’t been before.\nSo yes fresh scenery picks you up, but it’s your job to keep at it. Keep romanticising the city you live in, and the life you are building for yourself.\nI will meet so many new people. True and False.\nI love how all those who move to a new city or a country magically have an Instagram photo with 7–8 people laughing and drinking together.\n Let me in on you in a secret — making friends as an adult sucks.\n Maybe if you are going for a masters or joining the same jobs together, you have a connecting story for a while and that group photo makes sense. But if you are moving to a new city, all by yourself, chances are you know 1–2 folks and your new team mates.\nIt is not like college. Your teammates all vary in life stages — some have kids, some are newly married, others might be dating or be into rock climbing while you can’t climb a flight of stairs fast enough to save your life.\n It is messy finding your new tribe. It is a lot of work. Forming friendships take years, months if you are lucky. You will dearly miss the warm, easy dynamic of your friend circle back home.\n You will stumble across events, and classes, and meetups — to cross paths with a lot of people, who might show up on your Instagram and give the illusion you have found your tribe. Maybe you have, maybe you not. But this is what you signed up for when you moved.\nExperience a new culture. It is awkward. It only sounds good as a dating app bio. I want to travel and experience a new culture.\nYeah sure, good luck with trying to get your insurance sorted in another language, or not knowing why you got charged a ridiculous amount as water bill, finding food you can eat in a supermarket, standing while all your colleagues sing karaoke in a different language.\n New experiences if intercepted with time and space make a lot of sense and are comfortable. New experiences all squeezed together, with high stakes, because you moved to a new country where you don’t speak the language and need to make sure you find a home, pay the bills and feed yourself can be overwhelming.\n When you move, you have no chance but to buck and keep going. Maybe it means adapting to new weather or a new job, or learning the public transport or scrounging through the supermarket to find familiar things — the initial few days, every damn thing is a learning experience.\n It is not a paid, fully-arranged tour you know? There is no hand-holding or guides. Just be up for a lot of learning, some of which you would have rather not learned.\n So yes yay to new experiences — both glamorous and non-glamourous.\nGet rich. Lol.\n No seriously lol. Can we please talk about the immense financial budgeting pressure that comes with moving abroad?\n Have you every moved places? When you move to a new flat chances are you will find a missing bulb or a plumbing job or buy some basic cleaning products. Now multiply it with the scale of moving abroad.\n Setting up a life in a new city is expensive. Relearning to spend and manage your life in a new currency system is hard. It is harder if you don’t have a solid support system to fall back on.\n If it was that easy, a lot more folks would not have permanent homes. I had a relocation bonus I thought would cover the chunk — but after taxes and the surprises that you can’t account for, it barely covered my deposit.\nSo yes you might be earning relatively higher, but you also have a life in that city. Be better at maths, and asking tough questions to your recruiter/folks who live there. You know how at IKEA, you pick all things they are cheap? And the end bill you see is often a lot more, it’s pretty much the same here.\nTravel the world. This one is nice.\nYep, this is really amazing. Two hours to Paris sounds heaven (post-pandemic obviously). But, but — do not forget cleaning up your house, doing the groceries, doing dishes, laundry, deep-cleaning, paying bills, going to that Indian store to stock up spices, reporting that faulty toilet leak, finding how to clean your oven, fighting off mould, stocking up winter basics, and….you get the idea.\n After all, that city is your home right?\n But this is really really nice. This is that add-on bonus HR sells you and is actually worth it.\nBecome Independent. Legit true again.\nYep the thrill again. It is very liberating, so very liberating. This is my favorite part of moving abroad.\n No more log kya kahenge! Kaise kahenge? koi hai hi nahi yahan.\n [What will people say. There are no people to say!]\nThe side of independence that sucks - trust me lugging up 3 big suitcases to move into your new place alone, not having access to home-cooked food, not knowing when you will be able to see your family again, and just the feeling of security that comes being in the driving radius of your family.🥺\nSo yeah, these are all the things I wish I prepared better for mentally before I moved.\n It would not have changed my decision. It might have prepared me better sure. It would brought in a matured perspective and the trade-offs.\n Still standing happily by my decisions,\nChhavi\n Note: The author is a romantic at heart, and has a tendency to keep her rose-tinted glasses on.\n This blog is part of the blog series I have been writing around moving abroad for a job.

More so if you are making decisions and trade-offs every other hour, switching between meetings, giving out “quick” help, and tweeting while at it.\nLike most of you reading this, I have tried my luck at productivity tools, lists, retros, etc. And like most of you, I started off well but failed miserably after a while. While some may start saying words like consistency and discipline — I will not.\nLet’s be practical and not talk as productivity gurus here. I have immense respect for people who have practiced and mastered consistency and have well-organized Notion docs for all sections of their lives.\nI am not there yet— and I need a note-taking system that is more forgiving. A system that solves for 100% if I do it well, and 60% even when I fail miserably at it.\nI fail when I fall off the wake-up-early wagon. When I have to jump into Mondays because my weekends were full. When I am just too overwhelmed to spend half an hour writing about my day. I fail often, and so I need to give myself space for that. 🤷‍♀️\nMy main goals for note-taking Track my weekly work and mood For example, delivered designs for feature X, Presented in team-wide all hands, Feeling excited about this feature.\nCapture points I might not remember later Organized a birthday gift for X, Created quick mockups in an hour to get the Y feature rolling.\nCollect data points for my weekly 1-on-1 with my manager XYZ project has a conflict. My mood has been consistently so and so over weeks.\nActively shape my career I use all of the above to create a story I can tell in reviews and interviews.\nHow I went about doing it 📅 Created time on my calendar I have a recurring meeting an hour before I finish my day. If it’s after my last meeting, I tend to skip it as I am just desperate to get off my laptop.\nIt has the link to my notes doc attached. So I just have to open it and fill in my notes.\n⚡️ Simplified the note-taking It is a pretty basic word document with two columns — weekly and daily. I write daily for less than 5 minutes.\nNotes vary as per my mood. Sometimes I am super wordy and I fill in for days I might have missed and take time to go through my last few days.\nSometimes I just write a line (worked on X, need to complete Y). Sometimes I just miss doing it.\n💛 Made it forgiving — most important! I have 6 chances to write in (5 after workdays, and 1 at the start of the week). Most of the weeks, I do a good job of writing at least 3 times a week. That one day I am wordy, I make up for days I missed.\nI do not give myself a hard time about it. The alternative is (realistically) not doing anything. You have to work with the document.\nWhen I read through my short notes from 2–3 months ago, I am instantly reminded of things I did or how I was feeling at that time. That counts as a win for me!\n🔥 Use it well Doesn’t matter if you take notes daily, or once a week. You have to know how to make lemonade out of lemons! 🍋\n I work with what I got and highlight all points which can help me create a story later — be it to share with my manager, or for a promotion deck, for portfolio, or just to tell myself.\n Over time, you start getting a sense of good vs okayish data points. You then tend to take better notes more often.\nAnd that’s about it. I figured I should write about the system I have currently that works well for me. Maybe in future it would evolve and change with my needs, but for now this works!\nChhavi\n","permalink":"https://chhavishrivastava.com/blog/posts/chhavii/do-yourself-a-favor-build-yourself-a-forgiving-simple-note-taking-system-99d3d4fed319/","summary":"Documentation is really hard.

Build yourself a forgiving, simple note taking system"},{"content":"Having good managers can be one very strong reason you love your job. Good managers can be your coach, your therapist, your safety net, and your cheerleader rolled into one. I have always treated my managers like life coaches, mostly for navigating my professional career but sometimes also for sorting out personal stuff.\n But what if, one fine day your manager announces, they can no longer be that for you? 🥺\n Maybe they are switching jobs or moving up the ladder. Or maybe you are switching jobs. In either case, the weekly hour on your work calendar to rant, discuss, and get inspired is in danger.\nI have been tremendously fortunate to have very amazing folks as my managers. Each with their very unique voice and managing style, I feel they shaped me in a lot of ways.\nHowever, moving jobs and being in hyper-growth startups also meant my managers changed more frequently than I would have liked. From all of these experiences, almost 6 times over now, I learned some things.\nFirst and foremost, be as melodramatic as you can be. Well, things are going so well, why do they have to make the change now. Apart from all the things going on in your life, you also have to deal with this? It is completely alright to take time to process this, make sure you whine and be dramatic about it.\nOkay, now detach yourself from the situation. My mom used this analogy — we are all hopping on and off of trains to reach our destination. While on these trains, we meet people. So obviously people switching trains is very normal and expected.\nJust in this case, it happens to be your manager.🙃\nRealise it is not personal. They are on their own journey, their own career paths, and things they want to do with their life. Switching trains is troublesome and sometimes requires a lot of courage. The least you can do is celebrate and give them some good vibes as they jump off this one.\nBefore your manager leaves You are still very much on that train, and you should make sure you got what you need to carry on. Good managers make sure the transition is smooth and they set you up for success. Still.\nBe proactive in voicing out what you will need from them. Do you need some active feedback/ action items/a roadmap for your next promotion? Do you want them to introduce and help set shared expectations with your new manager? Do you want them to leave some specific notes for your future manager?\nPlay an active role in making sure your transition is smooth for yourself, rather than waiting to see how things pan out!\nMeeting the new manager Whether your new manager is reporting to your old manager, replacing them, or is completely new to the role — be patient, and kind. Transitions are often hard and it takes time to find a working groove, and build trust in relationships.\n If you know who your next manager is, don’t wait. Don’t wait for that official announcement, or your current manager to leave, or for the new manager to set up a recurring 1-on-1 with you. Set up 15–20 mins to have an informal coffee chat and acknowledge the new working relationship. Share your personal development plan or any other career doc with them. Agree on starting 1-on-1s as soon as possible, and get a running meeting doc started.  How can I understand my manager’s working style? Julie Zhou, the author of making of a Manager, shared how she does an exercise of writing a user manual for herself. Basically, it is a manual on how one can successfully work with you.\n“It creates clarity on how you work — what you value, how you look at problems, what your blind spots or areas of growth are, and how to build trust with you.”\nI picked up some questions from her blog you can ask your new manager.\n What do you consider a stellar job who reports to you? What would you consider a mediocre/bad job? How do you describe your communication style? How do you like to stay in sync with others/me (email, Slack, meetings, etc)? What are some things I can count on you for? How would you like me to handle conflicts? What actions can a person take to gain your trust? Conversely, what triggers you? Any other expectation that is unique to you and may differ from other managers.  Lastly, what if you are not going to have a manager for a while? While it sucks, it is what it is.\nLook around and adopt a manager. Or better, adopt a few of them! Maybe it’s a senior designer or a product manager. Maybe it’s a combination. You need to be actively working on your career, coach or no coach. Plus, we all have more shared experiences and learnings from our careers than we realize, and everyone that we meet has something we can learn from them.\nIf you start treating this transition as just another part of your job, and realise the person on the other end is also trying to do their best (be it your old manager or the new one), you will find this entire process less painful, and might even\nNow in my acceptance mode,\nChhavi\n _Special thanks to_** Ivy** for her suggestions, and all my managers and senior colleagues who have shaped my career so far!💛\n ","permalink":"https://chhavishrivastava.com/blog/posts/chhavii/halp-my-manager-is-leaving-me-746a31abb275/","summary":"Having good managers can be one very strong reason you love your job.

We started working from home in early March, and as we all know, everything that unfolded next did not come with a manual.\nAfter August, I could figure this will go on longer. How much longer? I still don’t know.\nI was super anxious —thinking if I get sick, how will I manage without speaking fluent Spanish. There were no direct flights back home, and no close family in the city. I did have a solid support system in my friends and colleagues (so grateful for that!💛), but I found London friendlier. I spoke the language, and I had close family members.\nWhen you think about job hunting in the middle of a pandemic, while you are on a visa in another country where you don’t speak the language, and you haven’t met family for so long — leaving your comfort zone and gathering mental energy to do so wasn’t exactly appealing. However, I did want to be proactive about how I handle this situation, and so I started applying to a few places.\nMy mindset was very different than when I was looking for jobs abroad previously. I was having fun at N26, and I was in no hurry to leave Barcelona. I knew I wanted to move to London, and I knew exactly what I was looking for in my next gig!\n🔎 Finding jobs I started applying through portals to test waters. I didn’t wanna reach out to my network for referrals yet as my portfolio was a work in progress, and I wanted to get a few practice rounds in.\nSurprisingly, I did hear back from a lot of companies. Completely different experience than when I was applying the first time around.\nMy theory for this is — N26 was a strong brand in the European/UK startup ecosystem, I was applying right when most companies were coming out of hiring freeze, my recent projects and experience were relevant to jobs I was applying to, and like always I was doing my due diligence while applying.\nMore on this part here in Part 1.\nMoving Abroad. Part 1: Tips for job-hunting.\n_Paying it forward, and writing down everything that I learned._chhavii.medium.com\nI chanced upon Bumble’s opening on Twitter and applied on their portal. I also messaged the hiring manager on Twitter just to make sure I had a fair shot at it.\n💬 Interview process One word, painless. That’s how I remember it because it was so quick and was very focused on capturing the right signals.\nInterviews 1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.\n2. Video call with Head of Design and Head of Product Design. I was expecting this one to be one of the last rounds, but it was the first and I was very nervous. It turned out to be a super warm chat where we took turns to ask questions. I could ask my questions — I had tons because of my requirement list, and they asked me some good ones too.\n3. Design Portfolio. I was asked to pick 2–3 recent projects and talk about them. I picked my most recent one and we talked in-depth about the process, flows, trade-offs, and visual design. 4. Chat with a User Researcher and a Product Designer — By this interview, I remember being very calm and relaxed. It was a very casual talk where we chatted about collaboration, past projects, processes, and team culture.\n🤔 Things that I think worked for me Personally, I was more familiar and prepared with how things work at a fast-moving, consumer-facing product startup. My answers and work showed that maturity as compared to last time. I was also very honest with things I needed to work on.\nThe hiring manager was looking to build a truly diverse team, with folks from different backgrounds and stories.\nAs always, I cannot deny the huge role timing plays. I saw that tweet at the right time, and the team had a role for my experience level.\n📑 UK Visa I was scarred by my Spain visa process, so I was prepared for this move to take months, especially in the middle of a pandemic. UK visa process surprised me and it surprised me so well. The entire process took around 2–3 weeks, and it wasn’t heavy on paperwork. Mainly it was a sponsorship letter from the employer, proof of my degree and that it was taught in English.\nI moved very much in the middle of a strict lockdown, both in Spain and in UK. Apart from everything that you have to arrange for a move (flights, sending your stuff, banks, new apartments, residency cards, etc), I also had to coordinate lockdown situations! That was fun. 🙃\nI was (am) very aware that this was such a big privilege — switching countries and jobs by my choice during a pandemic and so I took everything in my stride. I had to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days when I landed in London, and after that, I could collect my residency card, and start working!\n🐝 Working at Bumble I am a big fan of working at Bumble — not just because of the amazing product, but because of people and its culture.\nI will write more about this in my coming blogs — but very briefly, so far, really good. We are a surprisingly small team of designers (product and content designers) dedicated full-time on Bumble, around 12 of us last I counted. We all joined during the pandemic and at the time of writing, I have not met my colleagues in person. It’s been all through a screen — so yes I don’t know who is the tallest of us.\nI was also lucky to be around for a big milestone — IPO. Frankly, things did not change at all pre and post IPO. We are the same set of folks, working on the same set of challenges with the same energy and passion.\nAlso, I promise, I will write a thorough blog about working at Bumble in a few weeks.\n🏠 Flat-scene Make peace with the fact that London is expensive, and renting is super expensive. You know how they say London is expensive, it is. Very.\nI am told there are multiple small villages within the London city. Every “village” has its own personality and there is something for everyone. Any kind of house and any kind of vibe is on the market — for a price of course!\nSince I moved during a lockdown I did not have much time to walk around and compare these villages. So I picked something I was familiar with, and knew was safe.\nThere are both apps and Facebook groups to find what you are looking for. For a price, of course. Like I said.\n🥔 Food You will have absolutely no problem when it comes to food in London. It is a heaven for all foodies — even if you are vegetarian, or a vegan. Not just the restaurants, even the supermarkets are so friendly for Indian food shopping.\nI was pleasantly surprised to find Maggi, and Ghee in Tesco, a common supermarket chain here.\nSo yes one doesn’t need to worry about food when one moves to London.\n💸 Budget Okay so when I moved to Barcelona, I used to freak out thinking in rupees. When I move to London, I just convert to euros and roll my eyes. A lot of things like monthly groceries and transport were so much cheaper in Barcelona.\nI have only lived here during lockdown months, so I can very much assure you this budget will have to expand as things open up.\n A rough breakdown of my monthly budget in GBP.\nRent — 1200 Pounds for a shared apartment (Yes I freak out too seeing this number)\nUtility Bills — 400 Pounds (Watch out for the council tax when you pick a home)\nGroceries — 150ish\nTransport — Not sure yet, will update post lockdown\nTravel — Not sure yet, will update post lockdown\n 🌦 Day-to-day Life in London First and foremost, make peace with the fact that you will have to talk about the weather a lot, and basically plan your entire life around it.\nWhen I moved in November, it turned dark around 3 PM. With the freezing temperatures and lockdown, I seriously thought moving from Barcelona was stupid.\nThis is so new to me. You can basically never leave without a coat and a cap and gloves, or you will freeze. No matter what your weather app says.\nOnce you settle score with weather (not sure you ever do), you can start looking at the brighter side. Wait no sun for that, lol.\nNo, but definitely London is more friendly in terms of moving abroad — less paperwork, no language barrier, everything is super organized. I find it very similar to Bangalore (yes, sometimes even with the traffic)\nIt is a melting pot of cultures, the crowd is diverse and inclusive. It is really easy to blend in, and make London your home. A few days back, I walked across London, around 14 kms, and I had a chance to see it more closely. I am slowly, and steadily starting to love my life here. I will keep you updated here, or on Instagram!\nThank you for the patience with this part. With everything going on India, I found a lot of things highly irrelevant. I hope wherever you are, you are holding up fine, and keeping safe :)\nPart 4 Next Tuesday.

After graduation, and while working in Bangalore, I was looking for reasons to travel or move abroad as my weekend side project.\nWith my experience and profile, I figured I should diversify my options. So I applied to a lot of places for jobs — Ottawa, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, New York (yes yes I know how impossible the US visa situation is!). I was pretty much open to any city for the experience!\nI had applied to an N26 opening that had Berlin/Barcelona/Vienna mentioned. During one of the interviews, the recruiter mentioned I was being considered for the Barcelona office.\n Recruiter: “So what do you think Chhavi?”\n The open-source community I contributed to back in college, had roots in Barcelona. I had visited Barcelona before twice and had absolutely loved it. I had tagged it as “my city” pretty much on the first visit. I was always super grateful to be in Barcelona, but never thought I could ever live there. It just never crossed my mind.🙃\nThe recruiter stared back at me through the zoom call.\n Me: “I love Barcelona!”\n 💬 Interview Process A friend of a friend used N26, and he mentioned it to me. Mobile banks were still a new concept to me, so I did a little bit of research. A quick Google search listed all of these fin-tech darlings — Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26.\nI found a mutual on LinkedIn and requested a referral. I saw on LinkedIn that they had a few folks from India, so I thought maybe…maybe they do sponsor visas. Long haul, but worth a shot. I waited for a bit and heard back from a recruiter 2–3 weeks later.\nDesign interviews [You can skip this part if you want!] I was super excited to make it to the interviews. The “funnel” is so dramatic when you apply abroad — that this feels like an achievement. First I ordered and ate a lot of ice cream through Swiggy. Then I spent a lot of time preparing. More on this in part 1.\nMoving Abroad. Part 1: Tips for job-hunting.\n_Paying it forward, and writing down everything that I learned._chhavii.medium.com\nInterviews 1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.\n2. Design Exercise. I was asked to design a mobile application for reading curated books.\n3. Video-call to discuss the Design Exercise. My first chance to interacting with product designers on the team. We talked about the exercise, about the team, and in general how I could contribute.\n4.Video-call with a Product Manager and a Product Designer. Here we talked more about product thinking, our take on MVPs, using data, making trade-offs, and working as a cross-functional team. 5. Video-call with Head of Design. We talked about my career aspirations, how they see the team growing, how I could contribute, and on giving back to the design community and making the product more inclusive.\n🤔 Things that I think worked for me 1. N26 was looking for someone with my level of experience. Most of the times it’s not you. It’s just about what the team needs right now.\n2. N26 was building a truly international company, hence was open to sponsoring visas.\n3. The extra effort I had put to balance out my years of experience — I had prepared an analysis of the N26 app, and the ways I could contribute to the team.\nThe whole process felt pretty organic and I think took around a month. The part that was the biggest selling point for me was the people I talked with. I found all of them super respectful, and great listeners. We talked a lot about how they see the team growing, and how I could add to it. In hindsight, these conversations were such a strong indicator of why the team would be perfect for what I was looking for!\n🎉 On getting the job My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!\nIt wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.\n My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.\n 📑 Spain Visa N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.\nThe process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.\nI had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.\n Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!\n 🏦 Working in N26 Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️\nOn work\nWe worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.\nIt was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.\nI also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.\nThe office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!\nOn design team\nWe call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.\nWe had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.\nHonestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.\n Side note: I will share some more pictures on my Instagram stories here.\n 🏠 Flat-scene \u0026amp; Utility Bills This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃\nYou cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.\nBarcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.\nMy first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).\nI had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.\nUtility Bills I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩\nAt one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳\nWe could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.\n🥘 Food It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀\nAgain, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the Menu del Dia — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!\nI also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s ras malai.\n💸 Budget It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂\n A rough breakdown of my monthly budget\nRent — 650 Euros\nUtility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)\nGroceries — 200ish\nTransport — 50ish\nTravel (pre-covid) — 400ish\n ☎️ Language Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!\nI took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.\n👯‍♀️Friends and Indian community Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.\nI had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)\nI am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!\n💔 Pandemic It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.\nI remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.\nI was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.\n☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.\nEven though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.\nI sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.\nI would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!\nSomething I wrote before leaving Barcelona\nA love letter to Barcelona\n_Falling in love with a new city during lockdown_chhavii.medium.com\nFor more behind-the-blog moments, and fun things I curate, find me on Instagram here.

Most of the tips are applicable for all job-hunts, not just for a product designer role abroad.\n• On looking for a job abroad\n• On applying for the jobs\n• On interviewing\n• After the interview\n• On picking the job\n📝 This is a resource I have personally tried and tested.\n🙈 This is a hard truth.\n\nOn looking for a job 👁 Be on a continuous look-out. Are you waiting to update your portfolio? Or practice Leet code? Or awaiting a much-deserved promotion - before you can start that job hunt?\n Don’t wait. The best time to look for a job is when you don’t need one. If you are lucky enough to not need a job immediately, use this extra time to research companies and their cultures, visa sponsorships, and openings.\n Even if you know your portfolio is going to take another 5678 years, keep an active eye on the job market and make a wish list. Work on getting the balance between your preparation and market timing right.\n📝 How to think about your career by Julie Zhou\n📝Adding it up: the math behind designing your career by Kylie Poppen\n💰 Special focus on visa sponsorships 🙈 Because of how our world works, not all companies can sponsor visas, and if they do it is often limited to senior roles.\nSome job descriptions mention this, some don’t. Keep an active list of intel you get from folks, or simply through that trending job update on Twitter/LinkedIn. That worked for me.\n📝 Twitter thread on finding jobs in startups by Tyler Swartz. Funding is usually a good indicator of potential hiring spree/visa sponsorship.\n📝 List of companies that sponsor visa by Shubheksha\n💬 Reach out to people who have made the move Always helpful to learn from people who have made the move but take everything they say with a pinch of salt — chances are, their experience of moving abroad and yours will be completely different.\n🙈 Some folks also gatekeep, so just use your judgment here, please.\n📝 Ivy’s blog on moving to Canada, she’s been a sounding board for me\n📝 List of folks I know who’ve made the move abroad [WIP, will share soonish]\n📅 Prepare for alternate timelines. Have a Plan B. Apart from the length of interviews — visa processing can also be unimaginably long at times. Do not put your life on hold or, leave your current job till you have that one-way ticket booked.\n If you are a fresh grad, I would suggest you apply for a mix of companies both where you currently are, and abroad.\n 🔑 Consistency is key It might take some time, but it can be done. Please know this process is not a true reflection of your skillset, or how good your portfolio is.\nBe sure of your intent, and treat it as an important side-project in your life during this phase.\n📝 I am a big believer in Darshan Gajara’s Consistency Outplays Talent mantra. He had a roller-coaster journey of moving abroad, do read.\nOn Applying for the Jobs 🔨 Break templates Heads up! The resume and cold emails you used back in college might not work now. While you may not have a Spotify or a Bumble-themed resume, a scannable and relevant resume along with a well-worded genuine message goes a long way.\nI know a lot of us have lost trust in company portals, but I did get a few responses through them. Take time to intentionally fill forms. I know sometimes they are super long with super bad UX, but still do it.\n📝 Creating your design resume, Femke’s YouTube video\n☄️Show your over-preparedness when applying. Make it easier for others to help you — be it recruiters scanning your resumes or people referring you. A few just check LinkedIn during their lunch break!! Surely they do not plan to review your portfolio, fix your spelling mistakes, and find an opening for you.\n🌸 Genuine, polite messages for referrals only. Other folks may differ on this but I am more than happy to refer folks who reach out either because I have worked with them, or know them through a mutual connection. I do make sure that their profile matches the job requirements, and they are genuinely interested in applying.\n I found people are mostly happy to help you out, you just have to show up with the right intentions.\n Most companies have a referral bonus too. So, if you do want to apply through a referral, don’t apply through the portal.\nOn Interviewing  Getting that interview is half the battle won because from now you are no longer a well-edited piece of paper with auto-layout. You get to bring your personality, your work, and your voice to the table. Leverage this to the fullest!\n 🖍 Prepare a tailored presentation Learned this later in the game, but your website is for everyone. Your presentation should cater to a very specific audience — your future team. Showcase your personality.\nIt’s also a good litmus test. Were you comfortable presenting your whole self, or did you have to alter pieces of your personality to fit in? Give it a think, because you might end up working 40 hours a week with them.\n📝 Amazing thread by Michael Wang. This is the one I used.\n📝 Equally amazing thread on how to bring your personality\n😬 Know, it is just a meeting slot for someone 🙈 For most interviewers, it is one meeting between several other meetings.\nIf you have a higher stake involved in this, prepare and over-prepare, and be ready to take hold of the narrative.\n📝 Take notes Chances are, you are interviewing in multiple places and talking to multiple people. That red flag you found? You probably won’t remember it when you have to make a decision 6 weeks later between multiple offers. (I hope you get more than 1 offer!💪).\n💛 Have a SOS kit handy I started treating interviews as conversations, and (free!!) learning sessions from some of the amazing designers. It upped my game a bit.\nI lowered the stakes for myself and started treating it as just a job, not my entire life story. It changed my game.\nAfter the Interview 🐶 Follow-up In my head, I like closure. I did everything I could do in the interview and thanked them for their time after. So sending a follow-up note could be a thing you do.\nAlso, if hearing back from a recruiter/company could alter my life path, I make sure I follow-up.\n🏛 Consolidate your notes After every interview, set up a 10 minutes debrief session for yourself and note down the keywords you heard.\nDid they keep saying they want someone good with “design systems”? Did they say “new team, so more responsibilities”?\nAll these are key keywords to not only focus on for remaining interviews, but also during salary negotiations later.\n🚀 Manage parallel interviewing timelines well Self-explanatory, but you do not want to miss out on your dream job just because you applied to it later, or the recruiter took 2 extra weeks to get back.\nOn Picking the Job 💎 It’s a privilege To be able to choose where you work, and who you work with is a big privilege. Add on top, being able to move countries without thinking about visa is an unimaginable privilege for me.\nMake an educated decision on moving abroad, and not just because you find it cool. More on this in later parts!\n🤞 Take your time to consider the offer Please. After the tiring process, it is super tempting to just be done with it. Like a feature release, getting the offer is only the beginning.\nIf the company has made an offer, they have already filtered 100s of profiles to reach you. They will be okay taking a few days off to think about it.\n📝 My current manager, Lara Mendonça wrote this thread while I was considering the offer. I am ever so grateful it exists.\n💛 Choose people, over everything else If you are divided between two offers, or between staying or moving, I would say pick people. Be it people who you can learn from, or who make you feel more comfortable in being yourself. Pick people.\nI would have never survived the pandemic in a new city where I don’t speak the language — if I didn’t have the people on my team. More on this in the next part.\nI hope this was not all generic, and you found a few useful nuggets.💛\nIf you would rather like to see a video at 2x with a little more details, here is a talk I gave at my alma mater recently.\nFor more behind-the-blog moments, and fun things I curate, find me on Instagram here.

I would have truly appreciated any help I could get to get closer to my dream of living in Europe.\n My mom planted this seed when I was a teenager. She wanted her daughters to experience the best the world has to offer. And so twice a week, for four years, she drove me on her two-wheeler, come sun, wind, or rain — to French classes.

She planted the seed, and it grew up as me being super ambitious and determined to live in Paris in a studio apartment, and have a perfect French wardrobe capsule (she also got me monthly issues of Vogue).

I realize a few others on the internet (at least in my Twitter DMs) are on a similar journey.\nSo I took a weekend, to write about my journey and things I learned so far.

It was drizzling — the good kind of raining. It was there, but it wasn’t annoying me that my first day in Barcelona isn’t sunny. On the contrary, it felt like the city was offering me a clean slate.\nToo bad that slate did not come scribbled with instructions on how-to-do-2020, but then it wouldn’t be 2020 if it came with a manual. 🤷🏻‍\nI used Duolingo as a manual for Spanish, but one of the first words I learned coming here was “vale”, or more like “vale vale”. Everyone uses it here — and it just means yeah okay. The v is pronounced as a b, so it sounded quite similar to the Indian-Punjabi Balle-Balle. You do Balle-Balle when you dance, so the first couple of weeks were just me dancing around to vale vale.\nHow’s the new flatmate? How are things at work? Do you like the city? “Si vale vale”, I chirped for almost all of it. “But hey — why is it so cold?!”\n“Oh wait till March, city gets another life”, they told me.\nDecember 2019. Okay then, so I added Feliz Navidad to all my Instagram Christmas stories — and I waited for March.\nEarly February, I could start spotting some giris — a word locals taught me that they use for tourists.\n I was issued warnings by my colleagues to hold my purse tighter, and had to take a very solemn oath to not eat paella or drink sangria on the Rambla. It was a giri-trap!!!\n So entire February, I was using the metro which had now very much turned into a giri-fashion-runway. I helped click pictures on my way to work, and was already feeling a bit competitive with the giris about touristing around the city.\nMeanwhile, I also had just started taking Spanish classes, so I could pick catch words out of a conversation. Tienes is you have. Quiero is I. Bolsita is bag. Tarjeta is card.\n “Tienes {insert X}?”\nSi\n“Quiero {X}?\nVale, something something something bolsita?\n“Si, por favor”\nVale, something something something tarjeta?\n“Si Si tarjeta”\n_Shopkeeper super confused because he prolly asked me what else do I want or suggested another item or told me that this is the baking soda, not salt.\n_“Gracias. Adios.”\n Armed with my I-can-buy-groceries-in-Spanish confidence, I started going to meetups for hikes. Quite fun to explain why a solo Indian girl who can’t speak Spanish is hiking with them around almost-unknown mountains in Barcelona. But well, my Spanish, and my friend circle drastically improved. I now knew a couple of 60-something folks, who spoke only Spanish/Catalan, mostly lived their entire lives in Spain, and weren’t that supportive of giris and foreigners.\nMarch was here, and rumors had started. We knew that our neighbours in Italy were doing really bad, and it is only time that it reached us. But obviously like the rest of the world, nobody — especially me, foresee how big the wave would be.\nI would leave the numbers, and lockdown rules for history books. I could just tell you about tiny minute ways, very unexpectedly, life creeped in on us from behind the lockdown-ed doors. Sometimes bringing hope, most of the times anxiety.\nMarchil, Apray, Mune — like I just combines the month names, the events too are very much rolled into my head like the dough of a sourdough bread. They smell like my hand sanitiser, filled with Slack notifications, and nervous whispers of video calls with friends across the city, and family across oceans. So, I almost missed the mild strum of clapping over my pressure cooker’s whistle. I went to check the balcony, all my neighbours were out and clapping. It was 8 PM. They were all clapping for our health workers and people at the front line.\n….and then it became a ritual. Over the next few days, the neighbours next building and across the street became familiar. We found out the girl next door shared birth date with my flatmate. There was an old lady who always came out with her cup of tea, or maybe wine. A dog with a wagging tail in the balcony next to her. Below them, a gay couple. Wednesday was their mask day. A kid in the house across who kept tried to match the rhythm of the clapping with his tambourine.\nThe days we had the highest number of deaths, the clapping was so sombre. You could feel the sadness, and uncertainty looming. And then there were days we would do good, and someone would blast out a very upbeat song, and you could almost hear the relief across the city. Every night we clapped not just for those risking their lives, but also for us. We made it another day. And it was around this time, I started calling this city mine. I found myself whispering under my breath, come on Barcelona — you can do this. We got this.\nThe connections you form while enduring something intense together, also become intense. And it got more intense the coming weeks.\nWhen the new reality settled in — that it might quite some time that I can travel back home, or hug my loved ones, that’s when I needed to hold on to this city tighter.\nThe amazing thing about Barcelona is you can walk everywhere. Like you can walk through the arch of victory present in every European city, you can do that pretty church, the long main road filled with shops, and then the beach, and then you can do groceries on way back home. To my friends in Bangalore, or in London this might not seem so feasible. But this is the beauty of this city.\nSo I walked. I walked everywhere — one because I wanted to avoid public transport, and two because there wasn’t much else you can do anyways! So no I will not be able to give you the best boutiques to shop from, or the best bars to drink gin. But I can very well tell you where to get the best deals on daily buys, or whose chocolate croissant is the best. If my shopping is divided between 4 different supermarkets— I blame the lockdown, and me walking around aimlessly most days!\nMi barrio — the neighborhood, is another of my favorite word. Mi barrio is the best, because now I have locals running shop who know me, and can talk to me in my level of Spanglish.\nIn October, the previously new normal, had become a normal normal. Along with keys and phone, I know had masks and sanitizer in tow. I visited all the tourist locations when they were empty — I had it all to myself. I had the privilege to visit Gaudi’s masterpieces without being shoved, and I could walk around Barcoleneta beach without being forced to buy mojitos. I walked along the middle of the La Rambla without clutching my purse for my life.\nSo yes, years later if I mention I spent some time in Barcelona, and you excitedly ask me for bar recommendations or tourist places I would most probably draw a blank.\nBut I could tell you where to go for the best chocolate croissant, or which supermarket has the nicest, cheapest sushi, or the walking route that takes you around the city, or how to have a conversation in bare minimum Spanish.\nI could also tell you that Barcelona is a city I call mine. It is so deeply entwined in who I’ve become lately. It was here that I became self-reliant. All those days tied up in my room away from my loved ones, I had to find that strength in myself again. I laughed, and cried while walking these streets. I sighed when I saw a family restaurant close down. I jumped when I saw street musicians singing on the street again. And more than that — I always kept whispering to it, come on Barcelona, you can do this. We can do this. ❤\nWell if you enjoyed reading these, dropping a few hand-picked writings for you.

Of course with a cat!\n“Will pooping in my washbasin make you happy? Huh?”\nI asked, very concerned.\n“That desperate huh”, asked the person on the video call.\nWhat am I talking about? Okay, let me rewind. My semi-informally-adopted cat was acting sad. Why was the cat sad? My flatmate has these two absolute adorable furry babies. For this pandemic, she had to be somewhere else for a while (like more than a month). So for a while, it’s just me and them!\nFor more context, I thought I was a 100% dog person, never had to double think that one. Growing up I only had fishes, rabbits and turtles as pets. All of which if you note, cannot produce audible sounds. I do not have a stellar record with plants either. I once named a plant sunlight so that I can remember it needs sunlight.\nSo obviously you can understand my panic when one of the them was a bit off. Well okay, how do I know it’s off? It’s a feeling. You know when you are watching a video which says “watch-till-the-end”, and deep inside you know the end won’t be worth it and you are wasting precious few seconds of your life? Yes that kinda feeling. Nothing too dramatic, but it hurts if you are right. And hurts equally if you are wrong.\nSo yes, there is a watch-till-the-end option I can opt for — just wait for him to come out of his funk or whatever. Or. Or. Try and fix him.\nI try and remember all the key turning points in our relationship so far. Apart from sitting in his chair (which I found out was too comfy btw), and kicking him down the bed by mistake once (I though it was a fur cushion which I don’t own btw) — there was only one other. Right after my flatmate left, one morning I woke up to found poop in my bathroom wash basin. And he was next to it.\nWe figured it was because somehow, he was smart enough to figure one human is missing, and the other one is around too much. That stressed him. While that was equally stressful for me — he returned to being his playful self within hours.\nSo that brings us back to the question, that desperate huh?\nWell, yes yours truly now 50% cat person, former owner of pets who can’t make a noise, and a plant called sunlight, is ready to do what it takes.\n“But you are not even a cat person?”\n“Well what can I say. I am a I will not watch-till-the-end if you tell me to person.”\n","permalink":"https://chhavishrivastava.com/blog/posts/chhavii/will-pooping-in-my-washbasin-make-you-happy-432847e982fc/","summary":"Weird conversations in times of a pandemic.

But what about my soul?! Well being in lockdown (hopefully) does ensure I am building up immunity to fight the C-thing. What I do need is just the capacity to keep up and process (rationally) what’s happening right now, without having mini-breakdowns in my hallway or a video call.\nSo I google it. Ways to build emotional immunity.\n“Adopt an attitude of progress, not perfection.” OK, I did stop at 2 glasses of wine.\n“Stop trying to eradicate fear.” OK, I am still fearing the C-thing.\n“Be willing to see change.” OK, what if I don’t want to? I like airports.\nAll this is good, but where is that oh-that’s-doable, almost-Instagrammable, kinda-works hacks? So from my absolutely non-professional, not-selling-yet book, here are some things you could try that might not work!\n1. Build yourself a fort Learn ways to break an egg. Open wine bottles without a corkscrew. 1000 piece impossible puzzle. A jugaad standing desk you would use only once. A streak on an app. A Twitter following. Build something, something that you can see growing daily.\n2. Leave embarrassing proofs online of surviving a pandemic Never imagined yourself making a TikTok? Now’s the time. Play back-to-back Ludo with your family. Follow an insane makeup tutorial for blue ocean eyes. Watch Too Hot to Handle on Netflix. Do that. Being playful now is highly underestimated!\n3. Organise your own birthday party Yes I know it’s not your birthday yet. What I mean is have something to look forward to. Make yourself a chocolate mug cake in 1 minuteTrick yourself into being excited for that group video call you set up. Or the pizza delivery you promised yourself on Friday. Or that extra glass of wine at the end of the day. Be a good host of your party!\nHere’s everything that I could come up with. If you have something, let me know. Also don’t forget your ginger shots.

More of what I need? Patience and gratitude. It was my mantra for the year. The year where I had set two major ridiculous ambitious goals for myself. I started the year thinking there is no way I can do it. One done, one half-done. Nothing is i̶m̶p̶o̶s̶s̶i̶b̶l̶e̶ undoable, if we just set our minds to it. About the other half-done goal, it’s alright. Trust the timing of things that happen. More than your calendar, your to-do lists, or your Kanban board on Notion.  5. Also trust your instincts. Be slightly less scared, and be slightly more daring.\n6. Dare to unlearn things you’ve learned from your society and culture. Education is as much about the ability to unlearn, as much about the ability to learn.\n7. Learn everything. Just YouTube it out. Last week I learned how to open a wine bottle, how to use a coffee machine, how to choose a foundation for my skin tone, how to start a newsletter, how to read graphs…\n8. ..because it’s never too late. Never too late to learn stuff you should have learned in college maybe, never too late to start investing in your health, or to Google — WTF is OG?\n9. Never too late to apply for that job you think you would never get. Not too early to apply for that talk. Don’t self-reject yourself out from stuff.\n10. Accept and probe views that contradict you and your mental models. Once you find a piece of wisdom, act on it. No use of it otherwise. Like I cut down my meat consumption, and am (almost-ish) a vegetarian.\n11. Stop scrolling THAT feed, when you know you should. You always know when you should.\n12. Never underestimate what a 30 mins walk can do for you. Or the motivation your workout clothes bring.\n13. Never overestimate how hard that conversation will be. Most of the conversations are harder in your head, than they are in person.\n14. Climb that positivity hill. I built myself a postivity hill this year in my head. It represents excitement, humbleness and grate-fullness.\nWhenever I am in the rumble, I remind myself to start climbing it. Switch from being nervous and anxious, to being excited, and grateful.\n15. Or just sleep. Don’t try and fix your life — or a person, after 11 PM. Sleep fixes most of it for you while you sleep.\n16. Do fix yourself a good meal though. Being able to cook what you like, exactly how you like it, while in any part of the world, is really fulfilling.\n17. Replicate parts of your life as fast as possible when you move to a foreign land. Find that yoga studio, find that place to buy Maggi in bulk, hand those fairy lights, and..\n18. ..buy fresh flowers for your room, for your soul.\n19. We are more together in this, than we realize we are. (I wrote this before #CoronaDays)\n20. Find people that match your energy. It’s a thing.\n21. Also find that muesli you like. It has the power to cheer you up in the mornings.\n22. Share the authentic you, online and offline. Never post on Instagram for social validation, especially when you are feeling down in the dump.\n23. Hold the fort. It’s alright letting only very few know — about your love life, your next move, or your incomplete second goal.\n24. Post that blog. Even if it’s been two months since your birthday.

Apart from it being very true to its name, the Green bus was quite comfortable.\nTip 1: Really doesn’t matter if it’s 6 am, you can rent a two-wheeler when you get down. Just ask an auto-wala bhaiya where to rent it from. He will very politely charge you 200 bucks for 2 km, and wake his friend who rents the two-wheelers, at 6 am. Auroville is a nice 14 km, Google-Maps proof ride from Pondy. We stayed at the Green’s Guesthouse, which I would say was quite earthy and at a good distance to both the main road and Matrimandir. A little too good maybe, because the next day…\nDay 1, 6:45 AM\n Mustard: I would rather sleep in my room, than on the Matrimandir floor\nViolet: We are not going back without visiting the Matrimandir.\n In pouring rains, Violet and I hop on our two-wheelers and rushed to the temple. We went for an effortless no make-up, I-woke-up-like-this look. You have to book the temple a week before, using some link online. But of course, we didn’t do it.\nSo we were gonna try our luck by showing up as extras, desperately hoping that someone will be as lazy as Mustard and forget to show up.\n“The session is canceled today”, the guard declared, looking very confused seeing the two of us so excited for a 7 am meditation class.\nOops.\nBut hey, if it’s any consolation the small setup they built around the temple is very pretty.

And he drizzling rains can become pouring rains at any moment. But hey, priorities?\nTip 2: Stop by a nice local organic hand-made candle shop, plenty in Auroville. Buy some organic washing powder for your mom, incense sticks for that friend you need to get something for, essential oils just because they look good on the dressing tables, and of course candles. In fact, scented candles and food is how I will remember Auroville. Coming from the template-y, Swiggyfied restaurants in Bangalore, food in Auroville was like fresh air. Light on both, heart and pocket.\nTip 3: Definitely check out the Bread\u0026amp;Chocolate for some chocolate croissants, Auroville Bakery for some cookies, and Tanto for their heavenly pizzas. Tip 4: Once in Pondicherry, stop by local shops selling handicraft paper stuff, and of course more essential oils. There is also a really good Sarojini-market type of cloth street. Just ask anyone, they will take you there! While I wish I could boast of eating equally good food in Pondicherry, but we happened to order room service.

Imagine you are the designer on a project. You have spent weeks understanding your user, perfecting the flows and moving the pixels around. It’s going all good…until someone pings you.\nHey, I need to show this 3-line error message on this tooltip. Can you make it shorter? Also, can I use an “OOPS!”?\nWait, but why? Why can’t an error message be clear, crisp and concise? Who is making sure it sounds like a human wrote it? How do we justify we don’t use an oops?!\nIn the hustle-bustle of multiple projects, you pause and you look around at all your fellow designers and processes. You are designing experiences for the tiniest of details. But are you missing something?\nWe landed up in a similar situation a few months back. We all paused and looked at the words on our interfaces. Words that tell our users what went wrong in an error message. Words that help our users navigate through crucial tasks like preparing a disaster recovery plan. Or words that simply tell them, all’s good.\n Experience design starts with words; words that ask and answer a question. How do you want to make someone feel? What message do you want to send? What behaviors do you want to encourage?\n And this is how our journey of writing better words for our interfaces started. If you are on a similar journey or looking forward to starting one, we hope you find this blog helpful!\nThe first question to answer is — for whom? If we wrote a set of guidelines for words, who is most likely to refer to them?\nContent strategy focuses on all aspects of product messaging — emailers that you send out, the description of the app on the app store, marketing, etc. We decided to scope down our efforts to words that are present on our product interface, aka microcopy.\nFor our team, our goal was to build a single source of truth for those who write product copy — Designers, Product Managers, and Developers. If for you, the brand design team and product design are the same, additional roles that will benefit from this are — Marketing and Sales.\nWe then moved on to — the why. Why are we planning to invest in building our own UX writing guidelines? Will it be really helpful, or will it end up being just another section of our design system?\nTo establish a set of whys, we decided to get a lay of the land. Content audits play a crucial role here. We know, we know. It might sound like a tedious process, and product content doesn’t live in a single place like traditional web content.\nWhile we audited our content manually using our good old spreadsheets, there are plenty of tools and step-by-step blogs to conduct one efficiently.\nHere is a sample of the spreadsheet we used for our content audits.\n Apart from auditing content, we also audited our design processes to identify the gaps.\n How is the product content transferred between product managers, designers, and developers? Does everyone on the team have the same understanding of the flows and edge cases being built? Are we designing for screens or for dynamic user flows?\nConducting an audit of words and on our products, as well as processes around it, gave us our answers to “the why”. To start with we decided to focus on three areas.\n1. Inconsistent grammar and syntax\n2. Unthoughtful, non-actionable error messages\n3. Drab empty states\nNow is about a good time to start talking about product voice and tone. UX writing can survive with the fundamentals, but it can thrive with brand voice.\nFor a consumer-grade product, one is more likely to have a set of well-defined voice and tone. When it comes to enterprise, the users are considered to be more “serious”.\nWe need even more thought behind an enterprise product’s voice and tone because a human is using that product as part of his day-job, spending hours on it daily. Nobody minds a well-written message with an apt sense of humor.\nStarting with a few adjectives that define your product is a good place to start. This will also help you shape the guidelines around the use cases your product team will be handling.\nFor example, Shopify pivots their examples, vocabulary and actionable language around their merchants. MailChimp with its content guidelines focuses on talking about the people, for the people.\nWith this, we decided to start writing our holy grail for words. Some useful tips from our side:\n• Sometimes the principles become too abstract to use in day-to-day usage. While creating guidelines, it’s a good idea to explain how, and why those principles add value to the writing.\n• Use screenshots or product use cases as examples of the guidelines\n• Craft your guideline keeping in mind that some folks are there to read them, but most of them are looking for just that one thing. Proper navigation and an accessible location are a must!\nAt this stage, one might think the difficult part of writing the guidelines is over. If only that were true!\nSetting up processes around content and making sure, that the guidelines are not stagnant is equally important. We have come up with processes that work for our team to make sure we review and craft our product copy thoughtfully.\nTo make sure all the hard work of writing a guideline is put to use, finding a process that suits your team size and releases cycles is a journey you would have to take.\nWhile reading this, you might have wondered. But we don’t have a dedicated content strategy team? Well guess what, neither do we. We had a bunch of enthusiastic designers (read, I and Paul DiGioia) with a passion for writing. We took upon designing our content guidelines like a design challenge. For starters, you can do the same!\nWe are One team located in San Jose, San Francisco, Berlin, and Bangalore. We are constantly striving to create the right environment that supports great design outcomes.

Let’s get going.\nGet a Head Start  **Start early, start now\n**Wait, it has a summer in its name. Why start now? Stop thinking it is too early to start. Your aim should be to get to know communities, explore the projects they work on and build a genuine relationship with the members. Your efforts might end up in you spending the summer with them, but that shouldn’t be the driving factor of your conversations right now. “But I don’t know anything!” That is completely okay. GSoC is a program where students are (genuinely) encouraged to spend the summer learning new stuff. So let go all of your inhibitions, and decide to jump right in. Find an open source community to be a part of.\nThis may or may not need to be the one you end up spending the summer with. You can choose a community because you like the projects they are doing, it was in one of the courses in college or simply because your friend contributes to it. The official applications start late March, so it’s good if you take this time to build relationships with your potential mentors and other community members. Wait, you don’t know how to find a community?\nTake help of GSoC’s previous year organizations. There were 206 organizations taking part in 2018. Explore the project, the kind of work students did, and the communication channels each organization had. Don’t be lazy, do your research. Start lurking around.\nHang out on IRC channels, Telegram, Slack, Gitter, and mailing lists. Observe how a bunch of strangers, over remote locations, function in perfect harmony. Learn the rules on how to communicate, be it on IRC or any other platform. Respect them. Time to jump in.\nExplore the codebase of the organization that has got your fancy. Most projects have thorough documentation on what the project is and how to contribute.  Start Contributing  Enough with lurking.\nFind a small bug to fix or a minor improvement to make. Find issues tagged with #easy-fixes, #hacktoberfest, #newbie, etc. You need not move mountains. Even, fixing a typo in README.md is good enough as a start. Oh wait, do you remember I told you I know nothing?!! Don’t fret, that was me too. Learn enough git to be dangerous. Learn enough command line to be dangerous. Set up the local development environment\nSet up the local dev environment for the organization you want to contribute to. It is usually tricky. Do not estimate your skill set based on it. Read the documentation. Ask for help when you get stuck. Don’t give up halfway! Start thinking about your project proposal.\nBy now, you must have a local dev environment set up, fixed a few issues and even chatted with the community members. Organizations usually release project ideas before the student application period. Feel free to pitch in with your ideas. Help other newcomers.\nIRC channels start getting crowded as the application period nears. Don’t be insecure. Don’t be a jerk, it’s easy to recognize one.  Write Your Proposal  Structure your ideas for a proposal\nLook at the past proposals by the students of the organization. Go through any available guidelines by the community, like this one by KDE, or this by Fedora. Start structuring your ideas in the required format. My two cents, have one proposal which is solid, rather than multiple loosely thought proposals. Get early feedback and ACTUALLY implement it\nGather early feedback from the mentors and the community, and actually implement it in the final proposal. Don’t be a stalker or a creep.\nTalk to potential mentors about your ideas. Avoid messaging personally, unless the mentor suggests it. No one is going to steal your idea. You have spent time building trust with the community, it’s going to work for you now. It’s not about the idea, it’s about the potential to execute it. Play fair. Be honest with your timelines for the summer, free time you have and skill set you possess as of now. Keep in mind the timelines. GSoC is pretty strict about it and there is nothing that can be done if you miss them. Yep, nothing except waiting another year. Hit Submit. Ta-da!\nSubmit your proposal, and hold your breath. Just kidding, take a breath. You have done an awesome job!  Miscellaneous I read this advice in a GSoC experience before starting my journey, and this advice is gold. It’s a long journey, and self-doubt is a thing.\nFind a set of people who believe in you more than you believe in yourself. Read a lot of blogs. All students are encouraged to document their journey, so there is a lot of them out there. Check these out by Sambhav Kothari Rajika Imal Harshit Dwivedi\n500 Commits of Summer: My story of FOSS and GSoC\n_This story of summer started in a dull grey winter at home.

Add a UX designer to that list.\nTo give you a little more context, I missed my flight recently and had to book an expensive ticket back. I misread the time format. I showed up for a 4 pm flight when I had a 4 am flight. Silly, I know.\nWhen I was booking tickets for this family vacation, I was already very late in booking them. Sitting in a stuffed Uber Share in the annoying traffic of Bangalore, I switched between a few flight booking apps. Some had the am-pm format, some the 24 hours. I needed a late evening Sunday night flight. I used an ancient airline website (read, Air India) as they seem to be the cheapest. They send me a pdf attachment Gmail can’t read and hence, doesn’t add to my calendar.\nYes, yes I know. I should have used a smart app to book flights, a smarter calendar to manage my flights. Noob level flight mishap. But that is not my point, I will come to my point.\nMy point is. And these may simply come off as a rant, I agree to it. But the point it.\nWhen I was booking, why couldn’t the different flight booking apps notify me, it’s an early morning flight? There are only a few reasons people put themselves in the misery of an early morning flight, either the cost or work schedule.\nMy point here is, why couldn’t have a designer simplified the ticket that was sent out at my email address. It had everything upfront, except what I needed to double-check.\nAnd then again. Why was there no pre-journey message by the airline itself, to remind me to check-in/etc? Mostly there is, with Air India there was none.\nAll through this, I do agree it was a careless mistake on my part. But as a UX designer, I cannot help but pass part of the blame to an experience not well designed.\nJust a rant, as a UX Designer for another UX designer.

And that brings me to the very first point.\n1.Let go of the myths you hear.\nMost people out here assume, the only way you can contribute is through making changes in the source code. Recognising this as a barrier for newcomers is solving half the problem. In an open source community, you can contribute to design, marketing, documentation or simply helping to spread a word about it. Fedora’s what can I do will provide you the confirmation you need.\n2. I need to be a super-human first.\nAll you need to start contributing to open source is a willingness to learn and be humble while you do that. Agreed there are large codebases, complicated bug trackers, different contributing guidelines and all that. But there are also an amazing set of people, who truly consider open source as a means to change the world. And they will be more than happy to get you started. Now read the first line again.\n3. Become a part of the troupe.\nYou will be amazed at how in Bollywood movies, random strangers just pop in from nowhere and start dancing in complete sync. Open source is no different. It’s just a bunch of people, passionate about a project, coming together to build it. A few days in, you will soon find yourself catching their rhythm and the song they are dancing to!\n4. Be nice, help others.\nThe moment you type in a “Hi” on an IRC channel or a discussion thread, you become a part of the community. Which also makes you capable of start helping out others. Help the other newcomers. Paste the same links someone did for you when you started out. Find ways to help others overcome the problems you had when you started. This goes a long way in preserving the spirit open source communities survive on.\n5. Stick it out.\nFinding that first bug you can fix, getting your first PR merged, making an impact..all of this takes time. It is very easy to get intimidated by unusual IRC nick names, not getting prompt replies, having problems setting up the project locally, outdated codebases, and so on. Stick it out. Your contributions, however small they be, will be valued by the open source community as a whole.\nI hope this helps.

You read a lot. But you also read pretty mainstream-ish stuff. If you read what everyone is reading, you also think what everyone is thinking. Read to lead, dear.\n8.

So, better hit Publish anyways.\n11. In life, you get what you have the courage to ask for.\n12. Rescue a dog. Adopt it.\n13. Wear the most cushiony-comfortable-est shoes you can while you travel. Do not learn this the hard way, which you already have.\n14. Having a priority list makes a lot of hard decisions, easy. You know what I am saying here.\n15. People make all kinds of intelligent stuff you didn’t know you were living without. Use them.\n16. Do not compare anyone’s life through the Instagram-y filters. Appreciate, that perfect moment they framed for you to stumble upon while scrolling your feed. In short, like the pictures you like.\n17. B*itch. Sl*t. It’s not okay to let anyone label women like that. Speak up, right there, right then.\n18. Never go too long without a haircut that makes Coco Chanel proud. She is the one said, “A woman who cuts her hair, is about to change her life”.\n19. Everything is difficult until you do it for the first time. Bake that cake.\n20. Be choosy about the souvenirs you get back.\n21. Life’s best advice can be found in comic strips.\n22. Choose your people. Stick by them, through thicks and thins.

Start describing it. You might mention the artist, the album, the concert where you heard it, etc. All these (and more) are, entities. They make up the meta-data of your music.\nMusicBrainz is one of the largest open music encyclopaedia out there. If like me, you missed the MusicBrainz brigade party that started a decade ago, you are probably as lost as me when they say “We love our entities”. Well, never too late to join a party. Scroll down to know all about entities.\nSo this is me. My life goals are simple. Like really, all I wanted to do was appear as an artist in the mind boggling humongous database of MusicBrainz.\nSo I scribbled a few words and called it Darn Song 1. This is my darn Work, my distinct intellectual piece. Followed were just some of my best trials to sing. Trust me, it took a lot more audios.\n* So work is the idea, the raw material. A distinct intellectual or artistic creation. * While a work is mostly musical in nature, it is not necessarily so. A work could be a novel, play, poem or essay, later recorded as an oratory or audiobook.\nWhen the voice inside me saying “Stop this now” started getting louder, I decided to use some of these Instruments. Nothing much to know about them, except they make sound.\nI decided my original Recording (in red) is my potential shot at a chart block buster :D I then mixed and mastered a few others.\nMy cat has already hired people to make a cover of this track. The cover will have the same work, but a different recording. So you see, what a recording is now.\n* Recording is a “distinct” audio that has been used to produce at least one released track.  * A recording can be linked to any number of tracks\n* Each track can only be linked to one recording\n* Work is a layer above recording\nWhen my game got strong, I went ahead and recorded two more Darn songs.\nTo test the waters, I decided to Release them. Each release has track or tracks associated with it. One thing that you ought to know, singles can include upto as many as three tracks depending on the market. Mostly these are released for promotional purposes and usually expected to be most popular.\n* Releases are a creative output from an artist. * A release by an artist can have different formats/ mediums (cassettes, CDs, vinyls, etc) and different forms of pieces (singles, albums, extended plays, etc.)\nWoah. I seem to be hitting a chord with the public. I decide to do 4 more songs and release it as an album in an actual jewel encased case, because why not?! :D\nThis will be a release. You can walk into a store and buy a release!!\nI did this with the help of an Awesome Label. Well, our relationship dynamics are controversial but I now have a set of people who manage me and my recordings and releases.\nMy label thought it is a good idea to release some old school vinyls and cassettes for those who don’t like sparkle. Track sequencing can vary over various releases.\nTogether, the group of releases, will make a Release Group! Well that was hard to guess. :p\n* Release group is a single logical entity of several different releases.  * Every release belongs to one, and only one release group.\n I hope you are with me till here on my journey to appear in MusicBrainz. If not, feel free to drop by our IRC channel. We are a friendly lot. :)\n Woahh!! My release group (album) seems to be trending. People of my Area are especially amazed. This is the girl next door who won’t stop singing flamboyant songs in her bathroom? I was surprised too.\nMy other life goal was to be a boho-chick touring on road. So I decided to do Events. I named my tour “Darn You World Tour”. I performed in concerts, festivals, launch events and even masterclasses. My favourite Place to perform was this luxury cat vacation resort. All the events of this tour, will become part of a Series.\n* Areas are geographic regions or settlements. * A place is a building or outdoor area used for performing or producing music.\n* An event refers to an organised event which people can attend.\n* A series is a sequence of separate release groups, releases, recordings, works or events with a common theme.\nI retired after this and decided to spend my days writing these blogs and trying to understand entities. Then one fine day, I opened MusicBrainz. And guess what, I was an Artist. A friend of my cat made all the edits to my very own rows and columns of the database.\nAnd guess what more, you now know about all basic MusicBrainz entities.\n I hope this was helpful as a starting point. This series will continue as I learn more of what MusicBrainz has to offer.

On the 14th of September, a few girls gathered in their hostel common room to participate in the Fedora Women Day. The event was organised by me (also a student at the university), on behalf of the Fedora Diversity Team as part of their ongoing efforts to build a more inclusive Open Source community.\nA little context of the background here. IIT Guwahati is one of the premier technical university of India, with a very active student Coding club and high participation in programs like Google Summer of Code, Microsoft Code Fun Do, Build the Shield, etc. While we do have many students who contribute to FOSS, we have little continuous interaction and resources to help newcomers get started.\nI felt this event can be a good excuse to stir up some conversations about FOSS. And indeed, it did turn out to be a good conversation. We had around 20 participants that showed up, all very new to the world of FOSS. The initial part was mostly about getting them familiarised with the terminologies and varied organizations. We then talked about Fedora and how they can contribute. Most of them were really amused to find out that they can contribute beyond development. Later, we talked about programs like GSoC, Rails Girls Summer of Code and Outreachy which they can participate in.\n Overall, I would say we would do this event worked well as\n  We could plant the bug in their head that “Yes, contributing to FOSS can be a good option to learn. Yes, there are various organisations with varied requirement of skills. And yes, Fedora may be a good community to start with” It paved the way for future events, where we can possibly target higher participation and more intensive workshops. We could find students who were interested in various programs like GSoC but didn’t know where to start from. The resources required to conduct it were very less (almost none, except me and my time which I was more than happy to indulge!)   So how are we making sure the conversation doesn’t die out?\n I and Bhagyashree Padalkar have started a closed Facebook group to encourage participation in FOSS as well as address the queries and concerns of the newcomers.\nWe also are in process of setting up an IRC channel #foss-iitg to give them a common platform to interact as well as helping them get used to of the communication channels we commonly have in FOSS. It has both active students and alumni contributors to help out!\nSide Note 1: If you have ideas to add to this event, feel free to drop by.\nIRC Channel: #fedora-diversity\nMailing List: diversity@lists.fedoraproject.org\nSide Note 2: Even though the target audience for this event wasn’t supposed to be just women, due to shortage of time to organise/publicise, it ended up being a girls only party.

Writing it down here for people who weren’t there in the room with us.\n Just telling. Written like this, are action items for us.\n **Adding to our Community\n**When we started out, to lift Diversity team from ground zero, we decided to start organizing Fedora Women day to start with. Having women contributors on our team made it easier to reach out to the community as well. Now that we have a grounding, we aim to target more groups that comprises of the diversity.\nWhen we go around targeting more people to our community, there is something that we need to take care of. To truly make an impact, we need more people from that community to act as a link between Fedora and them. We don’t want to be like “Hey here is a celebration event for you by Fedora, come contribute.”\nNo. We will not do that. What we are desperately trying to do is actually recognise the unique barriers that each of the community in different geographic locations face.\n We would like to ask them and know, what is it that we can do better at? What is that we can do differently so that it will be easier for you to contribute to our community?\n We would want to establish communication routes that don’t just lead them to an isolate bubble, but to some place where their concerns are voiced and heard.\nThe other thing that we want to make sure when we go around asking people to join us, is to also make sure we have something substantial for them to contribute to.\n Find communication *links* between different communities and us\nMake sure we do not lead them to voids\n Event Planning\nThe team feels that coming up with a structure/procedure for organizing an event which makes people feel they can do it too. If we smooth out major hassles like budget, swag, target audience, etc..we can definitely hope to have people saying “Hey, this looks easy to organize. I can do that too in my community”\nBut, but. The *structure* that we add to an event, also shouldn’t restrict the organizers from making changes that suit their community. We need a framework that is their for their convenience and open to refining.\n_On this, a council member present at the session was happy to add “There is always more bandwidth and money for great ideas at Fedora”_\nOther thing. How do we decide that we want to go ahead with an event proposal by one of our ambassadors or a community member? Developing a set of questions to answer about the event which helps us analyse it’s impact, reach, budget and other logistics was something we talked about. So if someone needs out help, they need to show us how is that we can help them achieving that. A blog post link on the event page wiki is what we thought of. (This was discussed in further details in the session on Fedora ambassadors.)\n Adding more events to our calendar Coming up with a structure for our events, so that they are easier to organize by our ambassadors and other community members.\n Collaborating with other events\nWhile talking, it hit us_._ **_So why are we doing it all on our own again?_** What we realised from our discussion at Flock is that we can leverage the existing communities to catalyse our efforts. Girls who Code, PyCon Girls, etc were some that we could think of that we definitely can work along with. This will help us expand our reach, and organize efforts in much lesser efforts and budget.\nHowever when we collaborate, sizing the budgets will be something that the Diversity team will have to take calls on depending on the impact and the audience of the event.\n Find existing local communities and collaborate with for our events\n What we have out there.\nHaving an open session also helped us to recognize some of our unintentional errors as a team. The descriptions on our wiki page aren’t worded right at places. Though International Disability Day is a worldwide event, the contributors as well as the team felt the word disability comes across as very strong and often misleading. It is also rather broad, leading to an ineffective gathering of our audience. What we would rather like to do is to spear our efforts at a very specific community, taking time to understand their barriers and work with them to overcome them.\n To revisit our wiki pages and update them to reflect our ongoing efforts more accurately.\n **Impact. Did we actually make some?\n**Another thing we would want to focus on in the upcoming events is how do we measure the impact that we are creating. We have badges for the events so far and we can maybe track the number of active FAS accounts after a certain time of an event, but we definitely see a scope of exploration here.\nA simple self assessment here could be “Do I want to come back or do I want to organize this event? Why or why not”\n Come up with metrics to measure the success of an event\n Diversity Team\nMost of our efforts aim to have smooth boarding of new contributors to the different teams within Fedora. Amongst all this thoughts and ideas, something that also makes us wonder is, what does it mean to be a member of Fedora Diversity Team?\nHow do we define our roles and responsibilities? How do we add people to our team who share the same vision as us? Do we want them to be active Fedora users to join the team? (The answer to this was decided to be no, as the person writing this blog wasn’t one either when she started!)\nIn the coming days, we will also be looking to decide upon a member of our team to hold the position of Diversity Team Representative for the Fedora Council.\n Defining a process to onboard members to the Diversity Team\nChoosing a Diversity Team Representative\n That was almost all about what we discussed at Flock this year.

The last week of the semester. (I am starting to blog, again)"},{"content":"Over the years, me and my sister have been very insistent on getting a pet dog. My mom always won the arguement with a single statement “You both are already enough!” And just like that, the discussion used to end. So we found alternatives.\nFew fishes, all named and trained to come up to the part of the fish pot we tapped at. A baby turtle named Whiskey, which could slide down on make-shifts hills using books with erasers and sharperners as obstacles. And then a bunny, Chotu. I know, I know. A very lazy name to keep but we did try the cool sounding ones but it ended up with chotu because of it’s size.\nChotu was a fluffball. Like a snowball on a wintery christmas morning. A perfect cuddle after a long tiring day. A soft toy with long pointy ears and sparkling red eyes, tiny pink noose and rabbit-y teeth. It was fast, it could hop on to beds and it stood on two of it’s hind legs and used the other two to scratch his nose.\nWe took our love for a pet dog too seriously and hence Chotu ended up being treated as one. Over the span of two years, we got him poop-trained (somehow), run away from the pristine sofas when we shouted “NOOO Chotu” and come running from any part of the house when we tapped his food bowl. He even licked our noses to return the affection.\nHe had what we called “acquired intelligence” and “delayed response syndrome”. It took him a lot many trials to understand why all the commotion when he jumped on sofas and a good minute or two to first move one of his pointed ear in the direction of sound, get up from his stretched yoga asana, and then realize “Oh it’s food” and run to it.\nSo much so, that while in a typical phone call conversation from home while I am away “Khana kha liya?”, mom replaced it with “Chotu ne yeh khaya aaj”. We never believed in letting it eat the same old green everyday. We fed him rice-daal, pomegranate seeds, parle-G buiscuits, raw Maggi and even toast when it came running to us while we had our morning tea.\n It went on to the extend that my sister once told me that while I am away, for her Chotu fills up the gap I leave behind.\n I know I am sounding like one of those braggy parents who think their child is special. I may even be disillusioned and built up half the things Chotu did as his habits. So when he died this morning in his corner, sitting quietly as he used to when in his deep contemplating mode deciding if to eat rice or spinach leaves, I held back my tears for long. Afterall it was just a bunny.\nI read in China or somewhere, parents get a pet for their children while they are very young. So when the pet dies in a few years, the child learns the absoluteness of death as part of life cycle and learns to cope up with grief. This morning, even though I am now supposed to be an adult (which still sounds totally unlike me), I wanted to break down like a sobbing little kid whose pet which was supposed to live forever, died.\nThe last happy memory I have of him is him jumping on my bed in the middle of night and licking my ear. That scared the hell out of me as I woke up to two red eyes in dark staring at me. Turned out he just got locked in our room with his food bowl outside and that my glittery earring seemed like food to him.\nHe was never big on carrots or running around in greens even when we tried so hard to get him to do typical rabbit-y stuff. I wish he gets a tunnel full of bouncy sofas to jump on and rice-dal to gorge on. He will always be a our loved Chotu. ❤\n","permalink":"https://chhavishrivastava.com/blog/posts/chhavii/an-eulogy-for-my-pet-bunny-c137722898a7/","summary":"Over the years, me and my sister have been very insistent on getting a pet dog.

I confess I have been delaying this blog for long. All the shiz about “change is the only constant thing”, “change is good”, “blah”, “blah” only feels good to quote and put as Instagram captions.\n But when it actually hits you and your almost eight years old baby blog with a name you wished you had thought more about, it dosen’t feel so good.\n I wrote my first blog post when I had what I think was reverse-black-hole-of-words syndrome. When words were getting sucked out of me faster than I could contain them and I needed a safe haven for them. So fast, that I almost missed out a few vowels here and there (swear that was it, I wasn’t one of those kids who thought writing lyk dis ws kool!)\nWith a handful of readers (that included my mom and a few friends who I used to send the links to), I had found a non-judgy, dark and fancily lit disco to dance around with my words.\nI wrote about people I love, people I met, people who changed me. I wrote about amazing day outs and wonderful semesters and how divided I stood after having two homes. I attempted to write a story, a poem or two, which are the only two that have anything close to rhyming scheme. Now I can only do prose, basically words stitched together in short sentences.\nOver the years, while my writing found it’s way through words with vowels and sentences that had commas and full stops, a theme that ran constant was how I survived through situations. Be it how I survived the day right after a very bad haircut in high school, a biology exam, the swimming lessons, the valentines day, first day in coaching, first 100 days in college, salsa lessons or merely street shopping in Mumbai.\n A theme I still feel runs in me, survive the awkward and the difficult while having a verbal diarrhoea in my head.\n There was also a phase (a phase which I think might just be still going on) where I tried to write more sense-making stuff, in heavy polished writing which people who read will like. I started caring too much about the number of likes on my writing.\n Hitting publish after every writing took just a little more courage and a lot more overthinking than it did before.\n I have never been consistent in my writing. Whenever I took writing seriously, it seems to have deteriorated under the pressure of seriousness. And just when I let it dance without inhibitions in that disco I was a regular to, it seemed to sound more Chhavi-ish.\nSo with 40 blogs published and 26 drafts on Blogger, and the reverse-black-hole-words symptoms showing up again, it only seemed fair to renew my membership at the disco. Maybe a different one. This one dosen’t have the name I started out with or my childhood legacy of blogs posts and views (I can import all of it, but somehow entering the crowd without my dance moves seems more fun). But this one will have a more uninhibited (and consistent) blogger.\nTo my old disco blog, thank you, you have been nothing but a wonderful friend who danced as badly as I did. And to this one, you can finally have more of me. To writing more and writing again (this is in no way a part of find-cool-new-year-resolutions campaign I have going on).

Let me tell you a few stories. Around two years back, for sometime I had been lingering around the discussions in the IDF community, still in that learning user-interface-is-a-part-of-user-experience phase of a newbie designer.\nIn just one of my lingering sessions, I saw a message on a group chat asking if someone is up to do the ACM CHI 2016 design challenge together. Within hours we had connected. Turned out she too was a novice in design too and was venturing out with this. Armed with the user experience courses of IDF, we, living across the world to each other (she pursuing her PhD from University of California, Santa Barbara and I, Bachelor’s of Design, IIT Guwahati, India) and enrolled in full time academic courses, decided to complete this in less than 15 days. What followed were a days when we worked at odd hours, scrounged IDF for user experience courses and used excessive amounts of Google Drive and Hangouts.\nThat was then. Learning design can be overwhelming at the start. Or in the middle. Now, after gaining two years of formal education in design, an internship or two at reputed firms, becoming a part of a design research lab, building up my portfolio website and starting to write about design, I still remain a devoted learner at IDF and use it as my crutch to not stumble along this path.\nWith their gigantic resources of design literature, thorough courses, dedicated founders and versatile community, they offer you a place you can always fall back on when needed.\nI am a big fan of their “Daily Design Quote” that lands in my inbox every morning (doesn’t hurt to throw a few wise words when establishing your point in a discussion). The newsletter never fails to not have a link that piques up my curiosity and end up devouring it for the next few hours.\nThe best part : all it takes is a mail to reach out to them (be it when your credit card isn’t working when you have to recharge your membership or a simple is-this-good-design query).\nI still consider myself not experienced enough to start handing out “how-to-conquer-design” pamphlets or jot down “100-resources-to-help-the-designer” (sometime in future that too).

This year being no different, the sophomores went to intern across various fields that captured their fancy.\nThe work samples of most are enclosed within Non-Disclosure Agreement, but the memories and stories aren’t. Scroll down for a few of amazing intern stories, in their own words.\nStories Compiled by Chhavi Shrivastava\nDhruv Kohli, Srujana Innovation Center, Hyderabad\nAfter a blur of a journey that lasted for 20 hours and including being stranded at airports, I clearly remember entering into the Srujana Innovation center at LVPEI (LV Prasad Eye Hospital), Hyderabad, as a LVPEI-MITRA Fellow.\nAnxious and excited, I had the opportunity to work a varied set of projects, that included JULIA: _a paper based refractomete_r , designing a set of brand identities and user experience for a few products. I was also part of the workshop Engineering the Eye wherein I got to learn and be part of a multi-disciplinary global team.\nThe studio was filled with friendly people and encouraged all ideas, be it project related or weekend plans. Hyderabad as a city has many splendid destinations such as Charminar, Nizam Palace, Salar Jung Museum, and many more. My favourite memory was spending a day in rains near the Husain Sagar Lake and gorging on the delicious famous Hyderabadi chicken biryani and haleem. I cherish and miss the work, people and the air of the city, it was indeed a Shahi land!\nShubhank Pawar, WH Tech, Hyderabad\nI interned at the WH Tech which is a Hyderabad based startup working on wearable technology , whose focus is on mobile gaming through gestures. I had to co-ordinate with hardware , software and design departments and come up with ideas. From design patents to product mockups to UI/UX design , I got to taste it all and I am pretty sure I will assist them with whatever I will learn in upcoming courses. It was pretty amazing how a small piece of wearable tech could make a crane dig through the ground through gestures (in v5.0 hopefully) .\nP.S The product is in prototype stage P.P.S We are getting closer to Magneto’ s power!\nChhavi Shrivastava**, Fractal Ink Design Studio, Mumbai\n**When you think of a design studio, you think of some ultra cool people performing magic using Photoshop, massive bean bags, sticky notes in all shapes, and white boards with cool music in the background. Or something like that. When I walked in the studio, I found this and so much more!\nI was a part of team who was involved in the UX redesign of a global insurance firm. Over the time I spent there, I got an opportunity to learn from wonderful mentors and co-workers. I now can claim to have better hold on my design as well as management skills.\nSharing food and free font resources over countless teas, lounging on bean bags and blogging while the Mumbai rains dribbled across the windows in all it’s glory, spending summers learning and growing couldn’t have been better. A throwback video to the internship and all the wonderful wonderful people I met there! :)\nAkhil Patel**, Robert Bosch UX Studio, Bangalore\n**As a first timer in the industry, I had no idea what to expect. From the overwhelming experience of being in a new city with new people (whom I loved by the way), my cozy office chair, superb view of intense Bangalore traffic from the window and countless cups of coffee to the intimidating work and deadlines, I was offered a hell lot of things, all at once.\nI got to experience the difference in work cultures when it comes to big corporates and startups. Majorly from this intern I learned that first, it is too early to decide and stick to one thing so early in the design career, and second, I got to know what I DON’T want to do in life!\nMore than work, I noticed, I learned more in my leisure time interacting with the people around me. Initially hustled to settle in, but then all’s well that ends well right?\nPS: And yeah, one more thing, they had awesome free food at the office!\n","permalink":"https://chhavishrivastava.com/blog/posts/chhavii/a-couple-of-first-timers-venture-out-in-the-design-world-9b0d5f6edcf8/","summary":"Sophomores from Department of Design, IIT Guwahati, India and their intern stories\nEvery year summer brings with it’s a wave of internships and opportunities to venture out of our green and blue campus.

Just some of the things I have learned in a fortnight that I look back and in hindsight wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have mind stumbling upon before starting this intern.\n Test the waters before jumping in. After landing this intern, I messaged a few of my seniors who had already worked here and talked about the work culture and people. Why not learn from people who have been there and done that, right? You can avail frank and honest advice on a range of topics like from how to negotiate for stipend to getting in touch with the project manager beforehand. Master how to swish the magic wand before the duel. Be comfortable with the currency the firm uses to trade. I was not that very adept with Adobe Photoshop, I had mostly used Adobe Illustrator, so the first day had me struggling around. There is nothing which a marathon of YouTube videos cannot teach you. Also, get on the network used for exchanging files and updates, be it IP messenger, Slack or Trello. Mind those pixels and layers. You are now working on a real time industry project, not just another one of your course curriculum projects. This implies that you have to deliver pixel perfect screens and clean Photoshop files. It’s always comforting and safe to double (at times triple) check your work before forwarding it to your mentor/client. They are all professionals doing this for years and can easily spot even a 5 pixels shift in the cards (Yes! even 5 pixels) Talk to people. Possibility is that if you re working in design firm, you are surrounded by a lot of designers, all of them with their unique backgrounds, fortes and perspective on design (and mostly super friendly and ready to help!)\nTip : It’s sometimes intimidating to start a conversation with someone you find super cool and want to be in, say, 10 years down the lane. All you need is 3 seconds of courage to approach them and a few topics on your list, just to save a conversation-going-downhill. If it’s a designer, even a bunch of free vintage fonts you found online can be on your list. Stick around and be useful. Nobody would mind an extra help with their project, given that you are good at what you re helping at or at least a quick learner. Since you are there for a few days, and you possibly cannot be a part of every team you find interesting. Staying around for a few extra hours or lunch hours and exploring can be your way to make up for it. If you touch it, it is yours too! While working on a project, there is every possibility that the Photoshop files will be shuffled amongst the designers. It’s always good to clean and get familiar with layer names and groups before starting to work on it. It’s not cool sending files with invisible layers and locked groups to clients. **Ask for help, however stupid you might appear.\n**My mentors here have taught me how to mask and even select things using the command key. Instead of spending a few minutes struggling with how-to YouTube videos, asking for quick help is quicker. Take a break. Most of the design studios are replete with beanbags, music speakers and unlimited coffee for a reason. A few minutes break every hour to work is the key to work at the same speed throughout the day. Also, reaching early and having a few minutes to devour Medium blogs has done me much good.  9. It’s not all about the project!\nWhile interning, it is not just about the project you are working on. Even though it might seem very important to have a heavy project for your portfolio right now. Interning is more important for the experience of not what-you-work but how-you-work. Forming rapports with fellow designers, requesting leave in the middle of the week, finding your own style of working and identity in a design firm and going around asking colleagues on how to have fun on weekends. I have learned not to fret about the project now. Even though it might seem I am just moving a few layers and pixels around, I am moving it with utter perfection and patience. An acquired talent during intern, definitely.\n10. However cheesy, an intern diary will be cool. Years later, not now. It might be good to chronicle your experiences and work logs as you go ahead with the intern. Not only will you be able to marvel at how far you have come when you look at it years later, but it might also end up connecting you to some cool people.\nMore about my intern : I am doing my Bachelors of Design from Department of Design, IIT India and presently interning at Fractal Ink Design Studio, Mumbai for two months during the summer break after my sophomore year.
