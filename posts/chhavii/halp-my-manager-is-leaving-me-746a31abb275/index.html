They are on their own journey, their own career paths, and things they want to do with their life. Switching trains is troublesome and sometimes requires a lot of courage. The least you can do is celebrate and give them some good vibes as they jump off this one.\nBefore your manager¬†leaves You are still very much on that train, and you should make sure you got what you need to carry on. Good managers make sure the transition is smooth and they set you up for success. Still.\nBe proactive in voicing out what you will need from¬†them. Do you need some active feedback/ action items/a roadmap for your next promotion? Do you want them to introduce and help set shared expectations with your new manager?

Transitions are often hard and it takes time to find a working groove, and build trust in relationships.\n If you know who your next manager is, don‚Äôt wait. Don‚Äôt wait for that official announcement, or your current manager to leave, or for the new manager to set up a recurring 1-on-1 with you. Set up 15‚Äì20 mins to have an informal coffee chat and acknowledge the new working relationship. Share your personal development plan or any other career doc with them. Agree on starting 1-on-1s as soon as possible, and get a running meeting doc started.  How can I understand my manager‚Äôs working¬†style? Julie Zhou, the author of making of a Manager, shared how she does an exercise of writing a user manual for herself.

What would you consider a mediocre/bad job? How do you describe your communication style? How do you like to stay in sync with others/me (email, Slack, meetings, etc)? What are some things I can count on you for? How would you like me to handle conflicts? What actions can a person take to gain your trust? Conversely, what triggers you?
