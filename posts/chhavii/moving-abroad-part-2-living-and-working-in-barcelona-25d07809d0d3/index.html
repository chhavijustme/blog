After graduation, and while working in Bangalore, I was looking for reasons to travel or move abroad as my weekend side project.\nWith my experience and profile, I figured I should diversify my options. So I applied to a lot of places for jobs — Ottawa, London, Berlin, Amsterdam, New York (yes yes I know how impossible the US visa situation is!). I was pretty much open to any city for the experience!\nI had applied to an N26 opening that had Berlin/Barcelona/Vienna mentioned. During one of the interviews, the recruiter mentioned I was being considered for the Barcelona office.\n Recruiter: “So what do you think Chhavi?”\n The open-source community I contributed to back in college, had roots in Barcelona.

It just never crossed my mind.🙃\nThe recruiter stared back at me through the zoom call.\n Me: “I love Barcelona!”\n 💬 Interview Process A friend of a friend used N26, and he mentioned it to me. Mobile banks were still a new concept to me, so I did a little bit of research. A quick Google search listed all of these fin-tech darlings — Monzo, Revolut, Starling, and N26.\nI found a mutual on LinkedIn and requested a referral. I saw on LinkedIn that they had a few folks from India, so I thought maybe…maybe they do sponsor visas. Long haul, but worth a shot. I waited for a bit and heard back from a recruiter 2–3 weeks later.\nDesign interviews [You can skip this part if you want!] I was super excited to make it to the interviews. The “funnel” is so dramatic when you apply abroad — that this feels like an achievement. First I ordered and ate a lot of ice cream through Swiggy. Then I spent a lot of time preparing. More on this in part 1.\nMoving Abroad. Part 1: Tips for job-hunting.\n_Paying it forward, and writing down everything that I learned._chhavii.medium.com\nInterviews 1. Phone call with a Recruiter to discuss my background, and expectations.\n2. Design Exercise. I was asked to design a mobile application for reading curated books.\n3. Video-call to discuss the Design Exercise. My first chance to interacting with product designers on the team. We talked about the exercise, about the team, and in general how I could contribute.\n4.Video-call with a Product Manager and a Product Designer. Here we talked more about product thinking, our take on MVPs, using data, making trade-offs, and working as a cross-functional team. 5. Video-call with Head of Design. We talked about my career aspirations, how they see the team growing, how I could contribute, and on giving back to the design community and making the product more inclusive.\n🤔 Things that I think worked for me 1. N26 was looking for someone with my level of experience. Most of the times it’s not you. It’s just about what the team needs right now.\n2. N26 was building a truly international company, hence was open to sponsoring visas.\n3. The extra effort I had put to balance out my years of experience — I had prepared an analysis of the N26 app, and the ways I could contribute to the team.\nThe whole process felt pretty organic and I think took around a month. The part that was the biggest selling point for me was the people I talked with. I found all of them super respectful, and great listeners. We talked a lot about how they see the team growing, and how I could add to it. In hindsight, these conversations were such a strong indicator of why the team would be perfect for what I was looking for!\n🎉 On getting the job My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!\nIt wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.\n My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.\n 📑 Spain Visa N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.\nThe process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.\nI had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.\n Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!\n 🏦 Working in N26 Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️\nOn work\nWe worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.\nIt was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.\nI also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.\nThe office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!\nOn design team\nWe call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.\nWe had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.\nHonestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.\n Side note: I will share some more pictures on my Instagram stories here.\n 🏠 Flat-scene \u0026 Utility Bills This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃\nYou cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.\nBarcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.\nMy first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).\nI had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.\nUtility Bills I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩\nAt one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳\nWe could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.\n🥘 Food It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀\nAgain, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the Menu del Dia — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!\nI also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s ras malai.\n💸 Budget It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂\n A rough breakdown of my monthly budget\nRent — 650 Euros\nUtility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)\nGroceries — 200ish\nTransport — 50ish\nTravel (pre-covid) — 400ish\n ☎️ Language Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!\nI took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.\n👯‍♀️Friends and Indian community Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.\nI had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)\nI am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!\n💔 Pandemic It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.\nI remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.\nI was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.\n☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.\nEven though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.\nI sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.\nI would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!\nSomething I wrote before leaving Barcelona\nA love letter to Barcelona\n_Falling in love with a new city during lockdown_chhavii.medium.com\nFor more behind-the-blog moments, and fun things I curate, find me on Instagram here.

<h4 id=-on-getting-thejob>🎉 On getting the job<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-on-getting-thejob>#</a></h4>
<p>My last interview went really well, and my recruiter asked me for a “quick call” just the next day. I still remember taking the call, and asking her to wait a minute so that I can tell this to my family before we discuss other details!</p>
<p>It wasn’t much of an upgrade salary-wise, it was just a translation to a Barcelona salary level. I was also aware this means moving to a city where I don’t know the language or anyone from the product community. I also wasn’t sure what I would do after this career-wise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My key priority was to live in another country, learn a new language, and meet new people. Folks I talked to during interviews showed immense confidence in me, and N26 is a cool product. This clarity really made my decision easy.</strong></p>

<h3 id=-spainvisa>📑 Spain Visa<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-spainvisa>#</a></h3>
<p>N26 applied for a highly professional working visa in Spain. There is also an EU Blue Card, but this was a Spain-specific visa. I could travel freely within Schengen area with my visa, and my work status was tied to my company.</p>
<p>The process and paperwork were extremely long. It took months, at the end of which I had collected every piece of written evidence that I exist. Some of the documents were a police check, educational degree check, martial status check, (and many more)— and all of these documents had to be translated into Spanish by a verified translator.</p>
<p>I had almost given up on this and carried on with my life as usual. That’s also the reason I did not tell friends or family, it still seemed very unlikely things will actually work out. It took forever, and then it all happened very quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Almost 4.5 months after I was offered the job, I received an email that my work permit was done. In less than 30 days, I was on a one-way flight to Barcelona!</strong></p>

<h3 id=-working-inn26>🏦 Working in N26<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-working-inn26>#</a></h3>
<p>Where do I start? All my memories are filled with love, friends, and laughs.❤️</p>
<p><strong>On work</strong><br>
We worked in cross-functional agile teams. Funny enough, most of our team joined at the same time. So we set up our ways of working and rituals (aka meetings) from scratch.</p>
<p>It was my first time designing for a consumer product (that too with 5+ million customers at that point). I worked closely with my product manager, developers, user researchers, and fellow designers. Together, we built and released two big features and several small improvements to the app in like a year.</p>
<p>I also got a chance to work with data more closely, building dashboards for features, and our design team. Working with a localization platform was another skill I picked up.</p>
<p>The office is in a pretty cool barrio of Barcelona, 15 mins walking from the beach. It was the office of my dreams —a pastel colour palette, filled with dogs, and some of the coolest people I’ve met. We had folks from 40+ countries at one point I think, and we had regular get-togethers and office parties!</p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Zuao1eeBwnHGZqY16xiKlQ.png alt>
</p>
<p><strong>On design team</strong><br>
We call it the NXD team, and it has all my heart.❤️ N26’s design team is a very mature, multi-talented team of warm people. They provided the foundation and time for me to climb that steep learning curve in such a short time.</p>
<p>We had very fun, evolving rituals — be it the design standup, share backs, critiques or team celebrations. Within the Barcelona team, we also started something called Get-Togethers where we shared our lives beyond work. Pre-covid, we hung out after work, tried out fancy restaurants with our team budget, and also cooked for each other.</p>
<p>H<strong>onestly the people I met at N26 are why I could survive the pandemic, and am still super close friends with most of them.</strong></p>

<h3 id=-flat-scene--utilitybills>🏠 <strong>Flat-scene & Utility Bills</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-flat-scene--utilitybills>#</a></h3>
<p>This was one of my biggest challenges in Barcelona — just in like a year, I lived in 3 AirBnbs, 2 apartments, and had 4 flatmates. 🙃</p>
<p><strong>You cannot move to Barcelona thinking it would be like Bangalore — I will just find a house with a few of my mutual friends from college and hire help to cook and clean.</strong></p>
<p>Barcelona is a very multi-cultural diverse city, with the majority of folks having no relation to tech or Twitter. A lot of people treat it as a hallway, they come and go. It’s also a tourist city, rents can be crazy and landlords crazier. So you definitely have to relax your filters a bit and go out of your comfort zone here.</p>
<p>My first flat which I found did not work out for me. Just three months after moving, and right before the pandemic I moved flats. I got super lucky with my second flat and flatmates (and the neighbors).</p>
<p>I had to find a flat twice, and also find flatmates for my flat twice. I used Badi, Idealista, and Facebook groups. I still have nightmares I will have to use Badi again in my life.</p>
<h4 id=utility-bills>Utility Bills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#utility-bills>#</a></h4>
<p>I have no idea how much poorer I am because of the money I had to pay in bills which seem obscene for one person — all because I could not understand the language, or talk to customer service, or simply because landlords found me an easy target. 😩</p>
<p>At one point I paid like 115 euros for electricity per month. One month, our flat was charged with like 1200 euros for water — that is equivalent to filling 3 swimming pools!! 😳</p>
<p>We could do nothing to challenge it — except send Google translated messages to find out. We did not find out.</p>
<h3 id=-food>🥘 <strong>Food</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-food>#</a></h3>
<p>It took me a few hits and trials to figure out grocery shopping. Uff how I missed Swiggy and Zomato in the first few days. With time, I found these magical recipes called one-pot recipes. 👀</p>
<p>Again, Barcelona being a tourist city, there is (almost)authentic food from all corners of the world. My favorite thing about Barcelona is the <a href=https://www.thespruceeats.com/menu-del-dia-3083225><em>Menu del Dia</em></a> — it is offered by most restaurants and includes a starter, main course, a dessert and a drink for a very reasonable price. It made my lunch hours pre-covid super fancy and exciting!</p>
<p>I also found an Indian store to stock up on garam masalas, and get that occasional Haldiram’s <em>ras malai.</em></p>
<p><img loading=lazy src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OFL4q1TSXa1UuLujLy4cCA.png alt>
</p>
<h3 id=-budget>💸 <strong>Budget</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-budget>#</a></h3>
<p>It took me some time to start thinking in Euros. Like every Indian, for the first few months, I kept converting all costs into Rupees and freaking the hell out.😂</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A rough breakdown of my monthly budget<br>
Rent — 650 Euros<br>
Utility Bills — 150ish Euros (when I wasn’t being scammed!)<br>
Groceries — 200ish<br>
Transport — 50ish<br>
Travel (pre-covid) — 400ish</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=-language>☎️ <strong>Language</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-language>#</a></h3>
<p>Since Barcelona is a tourist city, navigating daily life through public transport, and restaurants is relatively easier. However, doing paperwork for residency, public health, utility bills, etc is when the language barrier hits you!</p>
<p>I took Spanish classes while I was there, and it definitely helped, but I still had to find help from either my friends or colleagues to do some pretty basic stuff.</p>
<h3 id=friends-and-indian-community>👯‍♀️<strong>Friends and Indian community</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#friends-and-indian-community>#</a></h3>
<p>Most of my friends were from my work. We became quite close, as we navigated the first few uncertain months of the pandemic together.</p>
<p>I had few friends from the hiking group I went to pre-pandemic, and then I had a really nice flatmate and neighbours (+ their friends!)</p>
<p>I am not sure about Indian community in Barcelona, as I was there for a very little time and there were no Indians in my office. I am sure there must be though!</p>
<h3 id=-pandemic>💔 Pandemic<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-pandemic>#</a></h3>
<p>It was hard. We had started hearing things were bad in Italy, but like everyone, nobody expected that it will hit us so bad.</p>
<p>I remember the day we hit the highest number of deaths in Spain, the mood was so somber on the streets. You could feel the shock and the hopelessness.</p>
<p>I was privileged to be able to stay home, and work from home. Shops were still stocked with basics, and apart from being in a complete lockdown for months, things went along like they did in rest of the world.</p>

</p>
<h3 id=-day-to-day-life-in-barcelona>☀️ Day-to-day Life in Barcelona<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-day-to-day-life-in-barcelona>#</a></h3>
<p>I have already told you this — Barcelona is my city. I feel like my true actual self when I am walking around. It cleanses my soul and makes me happy.</p>
<p><strong>Even though most of my time there was spent in lockdown, I made the best out of it. I joined a hiking group, took Spanish lessons, practiced yoga in a fancy hip studio in Gothic Quarter, and went to walk on the beach after work most days. I even dared to use a bicycle and became a pro at it.</strong></p>
<p>I sat in churches for hours, got lost by taking the wrong buses, tried all the weird yet super tasty sea food, and tried my Spanish on whoever would listen.</p>

</p>
<p>I would stop here, but you get the overall idea. I would definitely recommend you Barcelona, if your priorities match mine. I also mentioned some things which could be a deal breaker for you. Overall, I hope you found some of it helpful!</p>
